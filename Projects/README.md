# Projects

The project we have right now is to build something called the UberRadio.

As it turns out, the good folks at Tivoli Audio have built a very similar thing. They call it the [Model One Digital](https://www.tivoliaudio.com/shop/model-one-digital-wifi-bluetooth-fm-radio).

We hope this project will give you lots of ideas about how you can customize your UberRadio!

Here are some ideas :
- Add the LEDs to make it audio responsive / as an alarm function / so forth
- Make the display something special
- Add Mycroft AI to it?

Let us know what your UberRadio is going to do!!
