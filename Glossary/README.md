 <details>
    <summary>Annotation</summary>

    noun - the information added to a design that makes refering to things easier
            "I added the Q1 annotation."
    verb - the act of adding information (such as reference designators) to a design
           This can be done via automation or manually. It is often possible to add annotation to either the schematic or the board layout.
           "We annotated all components again to make things sequential."

 <details>
    <summary>Auto-Routing</summary>

> Software capability to automatically route a path between features on a PCB. Depending on what software you're using, this can lead your PCB to look like a "rat's nest." 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Back-Annotation</summary>

> The process of updating your schematic based on changes you made to your layout. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Ball Bonding</summary>

> The most common type of wire bonding used to make an electrical connection between a chip and another component on a semiconductor device. A very thin wire (typically a dozen micrometers thick and made of gold or copper) is fed through a capillary tube and brought close to the surface of the chip that needs to be connected. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire to melt its tip. When the wire melts, it forms a ball due to surface tension of the metal. The addition of heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy cause the ball to weld to the chip. (Image source: Wikipedia)
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Bed of Nails Testing</summary>

> "Bed of nails" are used to test PCBs and are composed of spring loaded tests pins that mate to different points on the PCB. This allows the electrical connections on the PCB to be verified. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Bill of Materials (BOM)</summary>

 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Board Outline</summary>

 > The outer contour or board shape of a PCB. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Bottom</summary>

 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>BGA (Ball Grid Array)</summary>

 > A type of surface-mount packaging which uses a grid of solder balls to connect chip to board. The chip sits on top of an array of solder balls. A BGA allows for a high density of leads, better heat conduction between package and PCB, and lower inductance in the leads.
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Clock Distribution</summary>

> A digital hardware design style which *distributes* a single clock source to **multiple** components. Clock distribution is relevant when multiple components need to share timing (whether that timing is synchronous or not is another design decision). Clock distribution can create problems because various physical factors (varying trace lengths, trace coupling, noise, etc.) can alter the different clock lines in different ways.
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Clock Skew</summary>

> Phenomenon where signals with the same clock signal arrive at different times. The difference in their arrival time is the skew.

    <summary>Conformal Coating</summary>

 > A thin polymer film applied to a PCB to protect its electronic components from moisture, dust, and chemicals. 
 </details>

<details>
    <summary>Controlled Impedance</summary>

> Without intentional design, impedance between two points on a trace is typically "uncontrolled." This is problematic for high frequency applications, and in these instances careful design of the dimensions of a trace and the material properties of the board is required to obtain controlled impedance and repeatable high frequency performance. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Convection</summary>

> Convection occurs when changes in the density of a fluid due to heating or cooling causes motion in the fluid. This mode of heat transfer is a common way to cool electronics. 
 </details>

> A highly conductive metal and good thermal conductor commonly used in certain layers of a PCB board to create electrical connections. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>DDR Memory Design</summary>

 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Electrical Test</summary>
 
 > Tests designed to verify that a pcb has been manufactured in accordance with its reference design. These tests commonly include a capacitance test to check for opens and shorts and a resistance test.
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference)</summary>
 
 > A disturbance generated by the electromagnetic field of one source that can disrupt the performance of another circuit. EMI can be either conducted, meaning that it passes through a wire or cable, or radiated, meaning that it wirelessly interferes with another signal. All electronic components generate electromagnetic signals that could potentially interfere with other equipment. 
 </details>

 <details>

 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Flying Probe Testing</summary>
 
 > Test to check that the electrical connections on a PCB are correct. During the test, two or more probes contact vias to test for opens, shorts, and component values. This test is commonly used instead of a "bed of nails" test when there is not sufficient access, the bed of nails takes too long or is too expensive to build. 
 </details>

 <details>
    <summary>Footprint</summary>
 
> An arrangement of pads (for surface mount devices) or through-holes (for discrete pin connections) placed on the PCB which is used to attach a component to a PCB.
 </details>

 <details>

    <summary>Thermal / Thermal Relief</summary>

> A small trace used to connect a pad to a plane and provide thermal relief. If the pad was directly connected to a plane then it would be very difficult to heat up the pad to a high enough temperature to make a solder joint because of the thermal mass of the plane. Using a small trace instead reduces heat flow and makes it easier to solder.

    <summary>Thieving</summary>

> Copper (often in the form of dots, grid, or solid fill) added to the outer layer of a PCB to ensure a uniform distribution of copper plating on the features of the PCB. The "thieving steals" plating current from concentrating on sparse features and instead spreads it out over areas with many features. This also reduces the amount of copper that needs to be etched away, leading to more even etching times across the board. It's also used to even out the thermal properties of a board to prevent twist and warp during the thermal cycling that occurs in the reflow process.

    <summary>Wedge Bonding</summary>

> Unlike ball bonding, wedge bonding requires the wire to be in a specific direction during bonding, so it's a slower process than ball bonding due to the extra time needed for tool alignment. Wedge bonding can use a larger diameter wire than ball bonding.
