In any case, click on the link for the **latest stable release** for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

If you are re-installing or "upgrading" a previous installation, please be sure to read the README file in the download to be sure you don't lose any footprints you have made (or any other work).

NOTE FOR Mac USERS - Right click to open KiCad the first time. You may also get a security warning that can be resolved by following the instructions that pop up when you click the information icon.

Verify that your installation was successful by trying to open one of our past PCB projects, [a snowflake PCB](https://github.com/maholli/snowflake/tree/master/snowflake_1). (Open the .pro file).
